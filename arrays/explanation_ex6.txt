The string 'margaret' was used to attempt to index into the array, since the index needs to be
an Integer, Ruby attempted to convert but there is no implicit conversion from String to Integer.

Use the integer index of margaret and assign 'jody' to that location:

names[names.index('margaret')] = jody
